# 📜 TOS Analyzer — Terms of Service Red Flag Detector

Have you ever blindly accepted a website’s **Terms of Service** or **Privacy Policy** without reading it? 😅  
You're not alone — and that’s exactly why this tool exists.

## 🔍 What It Does

**TOS Analyzer** scans any public Terms of Service or Privacy Policy page and highlights **concerning phrases** — things like:

- “We may share your data”
- “Without notice”
- “At our discretion”
- “Your data may be sold”
- “No refund”  
...and many more ⚠️

> 🧠 The goal: Help everyday users spot legal traps and risky language before clicking "I Agree".
